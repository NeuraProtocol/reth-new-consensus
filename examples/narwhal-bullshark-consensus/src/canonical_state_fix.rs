//! Temporary workaround for updating canonical state after database writes
//!
//! This module provides a way to update the canonical in-memory state after
//! we've persisted blocks to the database. This is needed because we bypass
//! Reth's normal engine flow which would update both DB and memory together.

/// 2. Use the engine tree with our consensus

/// This would look like:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// struct NarwhalBullsharkConsensus {
///     // ... consensus logic
/// }
/// 
/// impl Consensus for NarwhalBullsharkConsensus {
///     fn validate_header(&self, header: &SealedHeader) -> Result<(), ConsensusError> {
///         // Validate using Narwhal+Bullshark rules
///     }
///     
///     fn validate_body(&self, block: &SealedBlock) -> Result<(), ConsensusError> {
///         // Validate block body
///     }
/// }
/// 
/// // Then use with engine tree:
/// let engine_tree = EngineTree::new(
///     provider_factory,
///     NarwhalBullsharkConsensus::new(),
///     evm_config,
///     // ...
/// );
/// ```
/// 
/// The engine tree would then handle everything properly through its
/// normal flow: insert_block -> validate -> execute -> make_canonical
