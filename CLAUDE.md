# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-04 - Fixed database table initialization, consensus synchronization lag, and certificate deduplication. Tables now properly created, bounded channels prevent unbounded backlog, and deduplication prevents repeated certificate processing.

## Project Overview

This is a fork of Reth (Rust Ethereum) that integrates Narwhal + Bullshark consensus, replacing Ethereum's standard consensus with a DAG-based BFT consensus protocol. The chain is called "Neura" (Chain ID: 266, Coin: ANKR).

### Architecture Flow
1. **Transaction Pool** → Transactions collected by Reth mempool
2. **Batching** → Narwhal creates batches from transactions
3. **DAG Construction** → Narwhal builds Certificate DAG via reliable broadcast
4. **Consensus** → Bullshark runs BFT consensus on the DAG
5. **Block Construction** → Consensus output becomes Reth blocks
6. **Execution** → Reth executes blocks with revm

## Build and Test Commands

## Key Files to Understand

- `crates/consensus/consensus/src/narwhal_bullshark/` - Main integration layer
  - `service.rs` - Consensus service implementation
  - `integration.rs` - Reth integration hooks
  - `types.rs` - Type conversions between systems
  - `transaction_adapter.rs` - Transaction pool to worker connection
  - `dag_storage_adapter.rs` - Storage adapter (MDBX implementation)
  - `consensus_db_ops_impl.rs` - MDBX DAG storage operations
- `crates/narwhal/src/` - Narwhal DAG implementation
  - `dag_service.rs` - DAG construction and vote aggregation
  - `aggregators.rs` - Vote and certificate aggregation with BLS
  - `batch_maker.rs` - Transaction batching for workers
  - `quorum_waiter.rs` - Batch replication quorum logic
  - `storage_mdbx.rs` - Database storage (implemented with MDBX, some workarounds)
  - `types.rs` - Core types with BLS signature support
- `crates/bullshark/src/` - Bullshark BFT consensus
  - `bft_service.rs` - Main consensus service
  - `consensus.rs` - Core BFT algorithm
- `bin/reth/src/narwhal_bullshark.rs` - CLI integration
- `test_validators/` - Validator configuration files

## Running the System

1. **Single Node**: See command examples in `start_multivalidator_test.sh`
2. **Multi-Validator**: Run `./start_multivalidator_test.sh` (requires 4 validators)
3. **RPC Endpoints**: Nodes expose HTTP RPC on ports 8545-8548

## Validator Configuration

Validators use JSON config files with format:
```json
{
  "address": "0x...",
  "public_key": "0x...",
  "private_key": "0x...",
  "stake": 1000
}
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Async Everything** - Heavy use of tokio for consensus operations
2. **Type Safety** - Conversion traits between Narwhal/Bullshark and Reth types
3. **Modular Design** - Clean separation between consensus layers
4. **In-Memory First** - Current implementation optimizes for testing over persistence

## Development Tips

- When modifying consensus, test with `cargo test -p narwhal -- --nocapture` for logs
- The multi-validator test script is the best way to test full integration
- Check `NARWHAL_BULLSHARK_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed implementation status
- Most consensus logic is async - ensure proper tokio runtime handling
- Validator indices are 0-based and must match configuration order

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance

- Supports f Byzantine faults where f = ⌊(n-1)/3⌋
- Default test configuration: 4 validators (tolerates 1 Byzantine fault)
- Consensus requires 2f+1 votes to make progress

## Recent Implementation Progress

## Development Principles

- Always prioritise implementing full implementation rather than stubs, simplified versions or mocking
- **New Memory**: Never claim success before reviewing the narwhal, bullshark and consensus crates for todos, mocks, stubs and simplified versions

## Reference Implementation Location

- Always remember that there is a reference implementation for Narhwal + Bullshark at `/home/peastew/src/reth-new-consensus/narwhal-reference-implementation`
- Always remember that there is a reference implementation for Anemo at `/home/peastew/src/reth-new-consensus/anemo-reference`
